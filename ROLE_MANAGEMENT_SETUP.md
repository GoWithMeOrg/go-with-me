# Role Management System Setup

I've successfully created a comprehensive role management system for your Go With Me application. Here's what was implemented:

## What was created:

### 1. GraphQL Schema and Resolvers
- **File**: `src/app/api/graphql/types/role.ts` - GraphQL type definitions for roles and permissions
- **File**: `src/app/api/graphql/resolvers/role.ts` - CRUD resolvers for role management
- **Updated**: `src/app/api/graphql/typeDefs.ts` and `resolvers.ts` to include role operations

### 2. Role Management UI
- **File**: `src/app/admin/roles/page.tsx` - Complete role management interface
- **File**: `src/app/admin/roles/page.module.css` - Responsive styling for the role management page

## Features Implemented:

### GraphQL Operations
- `roles` - Query to get all roles
- `role(id)` - Query to get a specific role
- `createRole(role)` - Mutation to create a new role
- `updateRole(id, role)` - Mutation to update an existing role
- `deleteRole(id)` - Mutation to delete a role

### UI Features
- ✅ Create new roles with custom permissions
- ✅ Edit existing roles
- ✅ Delete roles (with confirmation)
- ✅ Visual permission matrix for easy management
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Form validation

### Permission System
The system uses the existing permission structure:
- **Actions**: READ, CREATE, EDIT, DELETE
- **Resources**: EVENT, TRIP, COMMENT, USER, ROLE

## How to use:

1. **Set up environment variables** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=/api/graphql
   ```

2. **Access the role management page**:
   Navigate to `/admin/roles` in your browser

3. **Create a role**:
   - Click "Create New Role"
   - Enter a role name
   - Select permissions using the matrix
   - Click "Create Role"

4. **Edit a role**:
   - Click "Edit" on any existing role card
   - Modify permissions as needed
   - Click "Update Role"

5. **Delete a role**:
   - Click "Delete" on any role card
   - Confirm the deletion

## Technical Details:

### Database Model
The system uses the existing `Role` model in `src/database/models/Role.ts` which includes:
- `name`: Unique role name
- `permissions`: Array of permission objects with actions and resources

### Apollo Client Integration
The page uses the existing Apollo Client setup from `src/app/providers.tsx` and inherits the provider from the root layout.

### Styling Approach
- Uses CSS modules for component-specific styling
- Follows the existing design patterns from other components
- Responsive grid layout for role cards
- Clean, professional UI with proper spacing and colors

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements):

1. **Add role assignment to users**: Extend the User model to include roles
2. **Implement permission checking**: Create middleware to check permissions before allowing actions
3. **Add role inheritance**: Allow roles to inherit permissions from other roles
4. **Add audit logging**: Track role changes for compliance
5. **Add role templates**: Pre-defined role templates for common use cases

The role management system is now ready to use and fully integrated with your existing codebase!
